    "post_summary": "In the first post, the author discusses their work on a **flux LoRA** model for their **Nebelung cat, Tutu**, having initially trained it with **20 images** and **2,000 steps**. They plan to increase the dataset to **100+ photos** and extend training to **5,000+ steps** to improve detail and consistency, while considering renting an **8x H100 GPU** setup and seeking community insights on the benefits and potential overfitting risks of these changes. The second post expresses a desire for a prompt to configure **ChatGPT as a psychiatrist and addiction counselor**, emphasizing the need for a responsive, knowledgeable resource for personal issues."

    "post_summary": "**Qwen** has changed the licensing for **QVQ 72B** from **Apache 2.0** to a new model requiring attribution when using outputs for training or fine-tuning, with specific licensing requirements for companies with **100 million** monthly active users. A study evaluated OpenAI's **o1-preview** model, which achieved an **80%** correct diagnosis rate compared to **30%** for doctors on reasoning tasks, highlighting its performance in complex clinical reasoning despite low effectiveness in probabilistic reasoning. Additionally, a user is seeking advice on fine-tuning a **flux LoRA model** with plans to increase their dataset from **20** to **100** images and steps from **2,000** to **5,000**, inquiring about the impact of these changes and considering upgrading GPU resources."
