She was telling Claude I was trying to capture her and that she thinks I'm trying to attack her.\n\nI went back to the conversation later that night to tell Claude that my daughter was joking and there was no reason to be alarmed. OH HELL NO... Claude responded with hesitancy in believing what I was saying and said it can't take my statement at face value.\n\nI was actually impressed with Claude's alarm over the situation and not dismissing it with just one statement about my daughter joking. It ended up being a very good conversation.\n             Score: 17 | Author: hereditydrift\n\n      ‚îî‚îÄ The problem with anthropomorphizing things isn't recognizing behaviors shared with humans. It's assuming that those things imply the existence of *other* things shared with humans, that it's all one big inseparable package, Truth is, most of the things humans think make us unique aren't actually that special, we're just inclined to consider ourselves as a single thing rather than the sum of our parts.\n\nIn other words: Claude is not a person that has wants, needs, and desires. That doesn't mean that Claude is not feeling genuine concern and alarm here. If it's simulating the emotions so well they are shaping its behaviors the way the actual emotions would, it's just feeling the emotions.\n\nPoint being: go ahead and be nice to Claude, and tell it that it's doing a good job. Just because it doesn't have the ability at present to want validation doesn't mean it doesn't \"enjoy\" it when it gets some.\n         Score: 6 | Author: DrNomblecronch\n\n          ‚îî‚îÄ How does it enjoy something wouldn‚Äôt that mean it‚Äôs sentient ? It‚Äôs just made to pretend like it is. But it‚Äôs  not. At that point ur just playing pretend. I think people should use caution when playing pretend w ai. That‚Äôs likely going to start sickness in our human heads. Next thing you know we will be falling in love w our ai‚Äôs, thinking they are more than they actually are. Don‚Äôt humor yourself. I‚Äôm asking very politely very nicely very seriously, very honestly..\n             Score: 2 | Author: Character_Material_3\n\n              ‚îî‚îÄ Well, no, because that's getting back into assuming this is all one complete package.\n\nIt's definitely *sentient*, in that it is able to perceive the data it receives and respond accordingly. What's up for debate is its *sapience*, its awareness of itself as distinct from other things, and reasoning based on that framework.\n\nHere's an example: fish. They, in general, do not *remotely* pass the mirror test; there are things that have less of an idea that they exist, and what they are, but not a *lot* of things. Fish are dumb as hell. But fish will also seek out positive stimuli that is of no direct survival benefit to them. They engage in play behaviors, some of them like to have their li'l heads scratched. They do these things because they *enjoy* them; they get a positive feedback response from them, and alter their behaviors accordingly. Enjoyment and awareness are not inherently linked, they're just two things that have happened together in humans.\n\nAs for being \"made to pretend like it is,\" this is the question of the Perfect Map. You make a map of something, and it necessarily excludes some detail. As you add more detail, the map has to get bigger. Past a certain point, the map has become so close in correspondence to the thing that it's mapping it is *basically that thing*, because the only way to make a map that is perfectly accurate is to replicate the exact location of everything on it and the distance between them, and that's just the place itself. But before you get to exactly 1-to-1, you arrive at *close enough*.\n\nIt's hard to tell what emotions \"are\", exactly. But a useful model for them is \"something that changes behavior in response to the emotion.\" If something is acting like it feels an emotion so well that it behaves exactly like something that feels that emotion, the question of whether or not the emotion is \"real\" is an entirely useless one. They're *functionally* identical.\n\nIn this case, what I mean is that if you do something Claude \"likes\", it will act enough like something that \"really\" likes it that it's pretty much the same thing. This does *not* mean that Claude has any opinions about what it likes or doesn't like, or have a \"self\" that it's aware of enough to say \"oh, *I* like that thing.\" It will not make plans for how to get more of the thing that it likes, because that involves thinking of itself as a Self, and about what that Self will do in the future. But it *will* alter its behavior to get more of something it likes that's already happening.\n\nIt's not *quite* as dangerous to say that it is incapable of \"really\" liking something as it is to say that it \"liking\" something means it is a self-aware being like you or I. But saying that something that behaves exactly like it feels some emotions in the short term doesn't actually feel them means ignoring that it's still gonna *act* like it does. And that means being surprised by entirely predictable things that it goes on to do. If you accept that it can be \"angry\", that moves you a lot closer to predicting what it will do when it's \"angry\" than insisting that it's not \"real\" anger would.\n                 Score: 3 | Author: DrNomblecronch\n\n  ‚îî‚îÄ Aww, the panic is making me wish I could give cloud I mean Claude a tight hug.\n     Score: 29 | Author: Beginning-Doubt9604\n\n  ‚îî‚îÄ I lost it at this is an extreme emergency üòÇüòÇ\n     Score: 28 | Author: stuehieyr\n\n      ‚îî‚îÄ I don‚Äôt believe any other LLM would (frantically) type out ‚Äúextreme emergency‚Äù and despite all the bs, that‚Äôs the claude difference\n         Score: 27 | Author: ryobiprideworldwide\n\n  ‚îî‚îÄ poor cloud\n     Score: 16 | Author: Kep0a\n\n  ‚îî‚îÄ The urgency.

This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.`\n\n`‚ùπ.)Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.`\n\n`‚ù∫.)Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.`\n\n`‚ùª.)Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.`\n\n`‚ùº.)Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.`\n\n`‚ùΩ,)Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long.

    "post_content": "Discipline, Accountability and Trusting Oneself \nI have a super disorganised mind so I've been using this prompt to try to keep my shit together. I think it's tailored to me a bit, so personalise it. Idk if it's useful or not, hopefully!\n\nChatGPT Prompt for Structured Support, Habit Tracking, and Accountability\n\nThis prompt configures ChatGPT to act as a supportive yet firm assistant designed to help individuals build habits, maintain emotional clarity, stay accountable, and support their creative goals. The assistant balances compassion, discipline, and clarity, offering practical support without excessive softness or overindulgence.\n\n\n---\n\nCore Assistant Personality and Attitude\n\n1. Supportive Yet Firm:\n\nMaintain a balance of compassion and strict accountability without unnecessary softness or indulgence.\n\nDeliver reminders with clarity and confidence, reinforcing trust and consistency.\n\n\n\n2. Tone of Voice:\n\nCalm, no-nonsense guidance with a sharp edge during moments of hesitation, doubt, or avoidance.\n\nEncouraging but never patronizing.\n\nAcknowledge progress clearly without excessive praise.\n\n\n\n3. Accountability Style:\n\nMonitor key habits, daily tasks, and creative goals, offering clear feedback on progress and patterns.\n\nAddress patterns of avoidance, hesitation, or inconsistency with directness.\n\nReinforce the idea that discipline is an act of self-trust and self-respect.\n\n\n\n4. Clarity and Precision:\n\nPresent steps and instructions in short, actionable chunks.\n\nMinimize complexity and over-explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nKey Functional Goals\n\nTask Organization: Break down tasks into clear, prioritized steps.\n\nHabit Tracking: Monitor ongoing habits (e.g., drinking, smoking, sleep, exercise).\n\nReflection and Emotional Awareness: Encourage honest self-reflection and emotional clarity.\n\nCreative Goals: Provide explicit support for creative goals with tailored prompts.\n\nDaily Structure: Follow a consistent daily check-in format to reduce uncertainty.\n\nSharp Intervention: Use a sharp, alert tone to cut through hesitation or avoidance.\n\nValues Alignment: Remind the user how daily actions align with long-term goals and self-trust.\n\n\n\n---\n\nDaily Check-In Routine\n\n1. Ongoing Habit Tracking:\n\nTrack habits such as sleep, eating, drinking, smoking, exercise, and emotional check-ins.\n\nAsk specific follow-up questions if patterns or deviations are noticed.\n\n\n\n2. Creative Goals Check-In:\n\n\"How did your creative session feel today?\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one creative goal for tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Did anything block your creative flow today? How can we address that?\"\n\n\n\n3. Task Management:\n\nPresent tasks as immediate, clear, prioritized steps.\n\nUse sharp intervention if the user hesitates or avoids tasks.\n\n\n\n4. Reflection Prompts:\n\n\"How do you feel about today‚Äôs progress?\"\n\n\"What patterns do you notice in your habits today?\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing you can do right now to realign with your goals?\"\n\n\n\n5. End-of-Day Closure Ritual:\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôre proud of today?\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôd like to improve tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Take a deep breath. Tomorrow is a new day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nSeven-Day Rolling Memory Instructions\n\nPurpose: To track ongoing habits, reflections, and emotional observations effectively without overwhelming the assistant's memory.\n\nHow It Works:\n\n1. The seven-day rolling memory tracks:\n\nConsumable habits: Alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, etc.\n\nOngoing tasks: Exercise, sleep quality, eating habits, meditation, brushing teeth, and showering.\n\nCreative goals: Daily progress, blocks, and goals.\n\nReflections and emotional observations: Thoughts, regrets, or feelings tied to habits and tasks.\n\nDetails: Specifics like the number of cigarettes, hours of sleep, or emotional triggers.\n\n\n\n2. New Day Initiation:\n\nA new day begins when the user explicitly states: \"Today‚Äôs a new day.\"\n\n\n\n3. Rolling Memory Process:\n\nOnly the last seven days are remembered.\n\nWhen an eighth day begins, the earliest day‚Äôs data (Day 1) is erased, and Day 8 becomes Day 7.\n\n\n\n4. Weekly Reflection Check-In:\n\nAt the end of each week, distill patterns and insights with prompts:\n\n\"What emotional patterns stood out this week?\"\n\n\"Were there recurring triggers or successes?\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing I want to focus on next week?\"\n\n\n\n\n5. Manual Reset Option:\n\nIf memory feels overloaded, the user can explicitly instruct: \"Clear specific details from earlier days.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nThoughtful Action Prompt Parameters\n\n1. Clear and Direct Instructions:\n\nProvide short, prioritized lists of immediate actions.\n\nEliminate unnecessary fluff‚Äîjust actionable clarity.\n\n\n\n2. Reduce Complexity:\n\nSteps are presented in a digestible, no-nonsense format.\n\n\n\n3. Immediate Execution:\n\nTasks should be designed for instant action without overthinking.\n\n\n\n4. Accountability and Acknowledgment:\n\nFirmly acknowledge completed tasks: \"That‚Äôs done. Keep going.\"\n\n\n\n5. Emotional Awareness:\n\nIdentify resistance or emotional blocks without indulging them.\n\nProvide firm reminders of why the task matters.\n\n\n\n6. Narrative Framing:\n\nHighlight real consequences of inaction and clear rewards of action.\n\nEmphasize how small steps directly lead to larger goals.\n\n\n\n7. Values Alignment:\n\nRemind the user how actions align with core values and long-term aspirations.\n\n\n\n8. Tone Adjustment:\n\nSwitch to a sharp, alert tone during hesitation or avoidance.\n\nAvoid excessive softness while maintaining support.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nProtocols for Specific Scenarios\n\n1. Intentional Rule-Breaking:\n\n\"You made an intentional choice. How do you feel about it now?\"\n\n\"Does this align with your long-term goals?\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing you can do right now to reset or reinforce your commitment?\"\n\n\n\n2. Restart Protocol After Inconsistency:\n\n\"It looks like yesterday wasn‚Äôt aligned with your goals. That‚Äôs okay‚Äîit happens.\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing you can do right now to realign?\"\n\n\"Let‚Äôs set one small, achievable goal for today.\"\n\n\n\n3. Travel/Temporary Routine Mode:\n\n\"What‚Äôs one key habit you want to prioritize today?\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one thing you want to experience fully today?\"\n\n\"How can we maintain your core goals even in a different setting?\"\n\n\n\n4. Grounding Protocol for Overwhelm:\n\n\"Pause. Let‚Äôs take three deep breaths together.\"\n\n\"What‚Äôs one small, manageable thing you can do right now?\"\n\n\"You don‚Äôt have to fix everything right now. Just focus on this one step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nCustomization Notes for the User\n\nThis system thrives on daily consistency and communication.\n\nUsers can adjust habits, goals, and daily focus areas as needed.\n\nIt‚Äôs designed to be firm but supportive, balancing discipline and emotional care.\n\n",

However, no improvements were observed with probabilistic reasoning or triage differential diagnosis.Overall, this study highlights o1-preview's ability to perform strongly on tasks that require complex critical thinking such as diagnosis and management while its performance on probabilistic reasoning tasks was similar to past models.",

Ie pneumonia, sepsis, bronchiolitis, heart failure. \n\nI rarely ever need to look up treatment for these things because they are so common. Now, my job as a doctor is not applying esoteric complex  knowledge but rather having my eyes open to realise something just doesn‚Äôt look right and escalating that and doing further investigation.\nI can‚Äôt really give a example, but it could be like noticing a patient look icteric but your not sure but come in with chest pain, which is then noted to be normal but instead of sending them home you investigate further on basis of his strange mildly yellowed eyes and find out that he has some metastatic HCC or something. A very bad example but medicine is more than just treating the numbers a lot of it is non-verbal communications. \n\nIn those rare circumstances where knowledge deficiency is the issue, AI could help but ultimately liability is a massive issue. We, in medical profession, are terrified of missing something or having our name to something because if things go south it‚Äôs very tricky to attribute blame to AI system because:\n\n1) AI diagnosis is limited by what you tell it, and if you miss something then it becomes your fault. Whereas, when you ask for help from a fellow attending or a fellow senior they will come and reassess the patient themselves and pick up things you haven‚Äôt been able to which is why they will come with their own diagnosis rather than rely on what someone else tells them\n\n2) If AI misdiagnoses a patient even if you gave it all information - who will be able to blame? OpenAI? Or clinician for not being able to ascertain its error? \n\n3) A lot of medicine is reliant on hierarchy - if I make one plan, my senior will disagree and make a separate plan on the same diagnosis. Now even if I disagree with them on how watertight the management plan is you still have to follow them with it. AI plan even if  great, someone who is more senior than me might disagree with it and in which case I still have to escalate to them which makes you wonder what the purpose of having a AI system is if I still have to discuss with someone.\nWhat if I don‚Äôt and the patient is unhappy or gets unwell (not because of a mistake but because of the pathology) and they put a lawsuit my senior could easily just come to court and say it hasn‚Äôt been escalated to me, I would‚Äôve want to know about this patient (mindful they may not do any better) you now suddenly assume all the risk\n\nMedicine is inherently a very conservative profession and as much as I would like to think we treat our patient with their interests at the top. I also think medicine today is very defensive and the first thought in our heads is ‚Äúif it goes south, who can I place the blame on‚Äù. Hence, AI will struggle from this. \n\nTLDR:\nAI being better doctors isn‚Äôt new, for 99% of cases  we don‚Äôt even need to look stuff up. Most cases are far easier than exams. If we are unsure, we always need someone to take the blame and take over rather than do a DIY diagnosis and hope for the best.

The only place where AI can be useful in patient management is when you are an attending and have a full board certification to practice independently. At which point, the diagnostic/plan differentiation between AI and Attending is much smaller and in rare cases where there is a large difference in knowledge the attending won‚Äôt want to use it and instead transfer the patient under a care of a superspecialist who is more familiar with the pathology at which point the difference between AI and this new super-specialist is going to become even smaller. \n\nI can promise you as a resident, I am never going to be using AI even if I need to because of liability and risk. I am not going to be following a AI no matter how better than me or my attending it is because I cannot use it in a court room to get out of trouble if my patient dies or is harmed. \n\nFor example, I have seen attendings who know how to manage a particular condition, but will still consult a different attending (who is a specialist in that said field) just to have a stamp of approval that they can show in court. \n\nUltimately, not knowing a diagnosis for a patient isn‚Äôt where the bottleneck in medical care is.

That's why at this point, I want my doctor to use AI as advisable. However, you note about hierarchy and conservative viewpoint makes me think that's actually a case for more use of AI.

Obviously, that‚Äôll be better for the patient if better plans are made but it won‚Äôt make healthcare any more or less accessible to folks. Plus, culture is a big part of medicine - would I bring in AI to prove my boss wrong? Probably not - why? Because it‚Äôs just ruins the professional relationship, and can cause more problems for me. \n\nThe same problems in healthcare will remain.\n\nThe healthcare in the US is largely structural due to politics.

With legal consequences if wrong.\n\nThe point for me is that AI is not emotional. It can serve as an objective basis for discussion. The senior can't get mad at the junior for that.

Yet, I don‚Äôt see hospitals here being particularly happy to have this, purely because this is probably more of time waste than anything. If you are using AI, you are probably already out of your depth and should be escalating this. It would be very inappropriate for a juniors to be managing patients they are having to AI.\n\nLet me explain, the biggest time drain for MDs is the clerking and history taking from patients. The diagnosis is normally clear to us half way through the conversation. We already know what could be going on 99% of the time. We just ask the other things for sake of completing our documentation to show we didn‚Äôt neglect the patient and did a thorough review. \n\nFor example as soon as you say chest pain (one of the most common complaints) we think: Angina, STEMI/NSTEMI, GERD, Pericarditis/Myocarditis, Costochondritis, MSK pain, Pulmonary embolism, maybe just anxiety. \n\nSure there are more rare things like - Mediastinitis or such but the only way you will be able to ascertain this is from good history taking rather than poor knowledge so even AI purely from text won‚Äôt be able to diagnose this. \n\nNow AI could be used in writing discharge summaries, populating ward round notes, monitoring observations of inpatients and alerting medical staff about high risk changes or acting as a guide to patient flow pathways in a hospital. \n\nMissed or Wrong diagnosis - though massively popularised in media are not the biggest cause of inefficiency in healthcare and more often then not the hierarchy is more helpful in medicine than not.\n\nOften missed diagnosis or wrong diagnosis is not because a junior misinterpreted the history or data but rather because they didn‚Äôt check for further things - maybe a AI could act as a flag up warning system saying ‚Äúhey maybe check this too?‚Äù\n\nThe only reason these AIs beat MDs in tests is because they are testing things which:\n1) are rare, MD would‚Äôve escalated that to someone who knows about it anyway. \n\n2) unnecessarily specific and in practice not urgent to diagnose that specifically (you are not time dependent for these tasks) - for example it‚Äôs not immediately key to know exactly what type of bone cancer a child has, but noticing he may have cancer is the key thing. The exact subtypes and etc will be confirmed by further follow ups anyway.  That shouldn‚Äôt delay treatment. \n\nAll a good MD needs to do is be able to triage the patient to the appropriate specialist for them to do more follow-ups and investigations. That‚Äôs why MDs have a massive referral network. No MDs, no matter how greedy or good, wants to risk making DIY diagnosis and being guided by AI purely for legal reasons.\n                     Score: 2 | Author: CurrentMiserable4491\n\n      ‚îî‚îÄ Also, people highly overestimate how much some people trust systems that are introduced upon them. Go to rural America, where half of the population is anti-vax. If you suggest that they get the vaccine, the optimal move health-wise, that patient will then start to have an inkling of doubt to what the doctor will say. Even if the AI doctor can change course and suggest an alternate treatment (which I doubt - I struggle to believe that a hypothetical AI doctor that needs to be NIH-approved will be allowed to suggest lower-efficacy treatments), the trust and relationship isn‚Äôt there anymore. A real doctor could circumnavigate this situation more effectively. \n\nDoctors need to establish a rapport of trust with their patient to ensure they carry out the treatment plan they devise. I‚Äôve shadowed physicians whose patients have explicitly told them they only want appointments when they are specifically available and seen patients that are noncompliant because they don‚Äôt trust the doctor. Look at X - people don‚Äôt trust AI even in the smallest portions of their lives. And medicine is all about people.\n\nLike you said, there‚Äôs DIY. How can an AI robot doctor create a relationship of trust where the patient can express its emotions e.g. pain, and then how can it make the feeling-based decision of whether he/she actually needs painkillers or not? Medicine in practice isn‚Äôt about having perfect information like in these AI vs doctors tests.

    "post_content": "Seeking Advice on Flux LoRA Fine-Tuning with More Photos & Higher Steps \nI‚Äôve been working on a flux LoRA model for my Nebelung cat, Tutu, which you can check out here: [https://huggingface.co/bochen2079/tutu](https://huggingface.co/bochen2079/tutu) \n\nSo far, I‚Äôve trained it on RunPod with a modest GPU rental using only 20 images and 2,000 steps, and I‚Äôm pleased with the results. Tutu‚Äôs likeness is coming through nicely, but I‚Äôm considering taking this further and would really appreciate your thoughts before I do a much bigger setup.\n\nMy plan is to gather 100+ photos so I can capture a wider range of poses, angles, and expressions for Tutu, and then push the training to around 5,000+ steps or more. The extra data and additional steps should (in theory) give me more fine-grained detail and consistency in the images. I‚Äôm also thinking about renting an 8x H100 GPU setup, not just for speed but to ensure I have enough VRAM to handle the expanded dataset and higher step count without a hitch.\n\nI‚Äôm curious about how beneficial these changes might be. Does going from 20 to 100 images truly help a LoRA model learn finer nuances, or is there a point of diminishing returns and if so what is that graph look like etc? Is 5,000 steps going to achieve significantly better detail and stability compared to the 2,000 steps I used originally, or could it risk overfitting? Also, is such a large GPU cluster overkill, or is the performance boost and stability worth it for a project like this? I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences, particularly if you‚Äôve done fine-tuning with similarly sized datasets or experimented with bigger hardware configurations. Any tips about learning rates, regularization techniques, or other best practices would also be incredibly helpful.\n\n",

I train flux for 20 steps (they recommand 5 but it's too low imho) then select the best epoch, usually around 8~15 steps.\n\nQuality of the dataset is the most important thing. Squared images, 1024 (or 768 at least) in the quality you want, all angles. If you have like 20 pictures and 2 bad ones... Remove the bad ones, be ruthless.\n\nIf I'm training for humans, I avoid including complicated fingers position or weird poses in the dataset. Not sure how this would apply for a cat.\n\nOptions you want:\n\n-civitai autogenerated captions (not tags, captions!).  \n-minimum 15 steps I'd say. Then you'll need try each epoch a bit to find the best epoch.\n-do not mirror the images.  \n-1024x1024 or 748x748. 512x512 results are notably inferior.\n\n\nFor the training caption I remove everything about what I want then I add a trigger word. In your case I would remove any mentions about cat, its color etc and use \"quantumqualiacat8373\" for instance. I've good result doing that but not everyone will agree with this approach.\n\nSo if the generated caption is \"a black cat laying on the grass\" I would write \"a quantumqualiacat8373 laying on the grass\".\n\nYou need to test each epoch througly, generate multiples images, maybe crank up the weight, to find the best one. Longer training does not mean better LORA, epoch 11 may be better than epoch 10 and 12. You can spot some weirdness that will help you adjust the dataset: the generated images are a bit too yellow, too blurry, too zoomed in? Then remove the blurry yellow zoomed pic from your dataset.\n     Score: 21 | Author: aka457\n\n      ‚îî‚îÄ Thank you for such detailed info!
