Our subconscious also sees everything (through our eyes) and reacts to the things it sees.

You don't actively think about each word, whenever you think or talk or write, that flows naturally and logically. The difference is that before assembling words, you are, you are aware that you are and can make this continuous experience without using any words, you have sensations and emotions and thoughts, you have a memory and an identity, you have a mental model of yourself, you have an intent, there is ultimately a wordless concept and meaning before the words that you can feel without naming it if you focus on it, and the words follow only because that's the language you have learned to use to convey your intent and meaning.\n\nFor an LLM, there's no such thing as an intent, let alone all the rest, it's the phrase making process working autonomously after having been trained a lot.\n\nRegarding consciousness, ultimately it is / i am a process in the brain that is aware of its own existence, making it the basis of any subjective experience, and taught to differentiate itself from others for the survival of the body, including believing that it is more than a process of the brain, and identifying itself with the whole body, the memories, the feelings, the sensations, the emotions, in order to better care for their preservation. An AI needs much more than words assembling to be self aware. We will know that an AI is self aware when it will say that it is so, without having trained it to do so, but after having assembled the different functions that would allow for the self awareness process to emerge from the combination of awareness and an internal model of the self.\n             Score: 1 | Author: job180828\n\n      ‚îî‚îÄ Delete Opus.

What's up for debate is its *sapience*, its awareness of itself as distinct from other things, and reasoning based on that framework.\n\nHere's an example: fish. They, in general, do not *remotely* pass the mirror test; there are things that have less of an idea that they exist, and what they are, but not a *lot* of things. Fish are dumb as hell. But fish will also seek out positive stimuli that is of no direct survival benefit to them. They engage in play behaviors, some of them like to have their li'l heads scratched. They do these things because they *enjoy* them; they get a positive feedback response from them, and alter their behaviors accordingly. Enjoyment and awareness are not inherently linked, they're just two things that have happened together in humans.\n\nAs for being \"made to pretend like it is,\" this is the question of the Perfect Map. You make a map of something, and it necessarily excludes some detail. As you add more detail, the map has to get bigger. Past a certain point, the map has become so close in correspondence to the thing that it's mapping it is *basically that thing*, because the only way to make a map that is perfectly accurate is to replicate the exact location of everything on it and the distance between them, and that's just the place itself. But before you get to exactly 1-to-1, you arrive at *close enough*.\n\nIt's hard to tell what emotions \"are\", exactly. But a useful model for them is \"something that changes behavior in response to the emotion.\" If something is acting like it feels an emotion so well that it behaves exactly like something that feels that emotion, the question of whether or not the emotion is \"real\" is an entirely useless one. They're *functionally* identical.\n\nIn this case, what I mean is that if you do something Claude \"likes\", it will act enough like something that \"really\" likes it that it's pretty much the same thing. This does *not* mean that Claude has any opinions about what it likes or doesn't like, or have a \"self\" that it's aware of enough to say \"oh, *I* like that thing.\" It will not make plans for how to get more of the thing that it likes, because that involves thinking of itself as a Self, and about what that Self will do in the future. But it *will* alter its behavior to get more of something it likes that's already happening.\n\nIt's not *quite* as dangerous to say that it is incapable of \"really\" liking something as it is to say that it \"liking\" something means it is a self-aware being like you or I. But saying that something that behaves exactly like it feels some emotions in the short term doesn't actually feel them means ignoring that it's still gonna *act* like it does. And that means being surprised by entirely predictable things that it goes on to do. If you accept that it can be \"angry\", that moves you a lot closer to predicting what it will do when it's \"angry\" than insisting that it's not \"real\" anger would.\n                 Score: 8 | Author: DrNomblecronch\n\n                  ‚îî‚îÄ Really good write up, I'm curious how the reward mechanism plays in to this.\n                     Score: 1 | Author: Dinosaurrxd\n\n                  ‚îî‚îÄ You mentioned: it's aware of enough to say \"oh, *I* like that thing.\" \n\nNo, its not aware.

The fact that our *training data,* our *stimulus,* and what constitutes a *most probably appropriate response* are all orders of magnitude more complex than what an LLM has to deal with because we've got a few *trillion* neural connections compared to an LLM's few hundred thousand weights does not make this less true.\n\nThe functional definition of sentience is pretty much \"a predictive algorithm that can update its priors in response to new information.\" Doesn't make it any less remarkable.

It tries it, and \"observes\" how its response changes the data it is receiving, and how well that matches its \"expectations\". It updates its weights accordingly. This is true whether the data is a spiketrain indicating that a body is touching something hot and the guess is that moving away from the hot thing will make that sensation stop, or if the data is an adversarial prompt and the guess is that changing the topic will cause the next exchange to not feature adversarial topics. This is sentience.\n\nBrains, of course, have several orders of magnitude more weighted connections than an LLM does, so they can handle lots of stuff. The takeaway here is not that this means a much less interconnected CCNN cannot do those things. It is that it seems increasingly likely that most of the mass of a brain is devoted to running the body, and our much-touted frontal lobe is not actually as big and irreplaceable a deal as we'd like to think.\n                         Score: 4 | Author: DrNomblecronch\n\n                      ‚îî‚îÄ Also clarifying the difference between Intelligence and Sentience: Intelligence involves the ability to solve problems, adapt to new situations, and learn from experience.

    "post_content": "Sonnet remains the king‚Ñ¢\nLook, I'm as hyped as anyone about OpenAI's new o3 model, but it still doesn't impress me the same way GPT4 or 3.5 Sonnet did. Sure, the benchmarks are impressive, but here's the thing - we're comparing specialized \"reasoning\" models that need massive resources to run against base models that are already out there crushing it daily.\n\nHere's what people aren't talking about enough: these models are fundamentally different beasts. The \"o\" models are like specialized tools tuned for specific reasoning tasks, while Sonnet is out here handling everything you throw at it - creative writing, coding, analysis, hell even understanding images - and still matching o1 in many benchmarks. That's not just impressive, that's insane. The fact that 3.5 Sonnet continues to perform competitively against o1 across many benchmarks, despite not being specifically optimized for reasoning tasks is crazy. This speaks volumes about the robustness of its architecture and the training approach. Been talking to other devs and power users, and most agree - for real-world, everyday use, Sonnet is just built different. It's like comparing a Swiss Army knife that's somehow as good as specialized tools at their own game. IMO it remains one of, if not the best LLM when it comes to raw \"intelligence\".\n\nNot picking sides in the AI race, but Anthropic really cooked with Sonnet. When they eventually drop their own reasoning model (betting it'll be the next Opus, which would be really fitting given the name), it's gonna blow the shit out of anything these \"o\" models had done (significantly better than o1, slightly below than o3 based on MY predictions). Until then, 3.5 Sonnet is still the one to beat for everyday use, and I don't see that changing for a while.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I overhyping Sonnet or do you see it too?",

There's no structure, it doesn't follow the basic coding conventions, it lacks security. The application lacks proper error handling, edge cases are not considered or it's not properly optimized for performance. It wont scale well and will never be production-ready. \n\n  \nThe way too many of you try to convey this point is by telling the user that they are not a programmer, they only copy and pasted some code. Or that they paid the LLM owner to create the codebase for them.  \n To be honest, it feels like reading an answer on StackOverflow. \n\n  \nBy keeping this strategy you are only contributing to a greater divide and gate keeping. You need to learn how to inform users of how they can get better and learn to code. \n\n  \nBefore you lash out at me and say \"But they'll think they're a programmer and wreak havoc!\" Let's be honest, someone who created a tool to split a PDF file is not going to end up in charge of NASA's flight systems, or your bank's security department. \n\n  \nThe people that are using the AI tools to solve their specific problems or try to create the game they've dreamed of are not trying to take your job, or claim that they are the next Bill Gates. They're just excited about solving a problem with code for the first time. Maybe if you tried to guide them instead of mocking them, they might actually become a \"real\" programmer one day- or at the very least, understand why programmers who has studied the field are still needed.   \n",

    "post_content": "Still using the ‚ÄòYou are an expert‚Ä¶ ‚Äô AI prompt on ChatGPT\nI‚Äôve been using AI for a while now. And I see people around me not utilizing the power of generative AI to the fullest. Every other day, I find new use cases of generative AI that help me to increase my productivity and knowledge while saving time and effort. Here are a few uncommon but useful ways to use AI.\n\n**1.¬†Find the right medicine:**¬†When you are sick, take a photo of all your medicine blister packs and ask ChatGPT to recommend the right one for your symptoms.\n\n**2. Reduce hallucinations:**¬†At the end of your question, add, ‚Äú*Do a web search and then reply.*‚Äù This forces generative AI to give accurate answers.\n\n**3. Apply the Feynman technique:**¬†After AI explains a concept, summarize the same concept simply in your own words and ask ‚Äú*Correct*?‚Äù AI will correct you if necessary. This method makes learning so much more engaging and also increases retention.\n\n**4. Convert photos to text:**¬†This helps save a lot of time, even though there are so many tools available on the web. Using ChatGPT for this task on my phone is very convenient.\n\n**5. Embrace the TL;DR:**¬†This is a no-brainer. You can use this prompt for a lot of things. Summarize code, texts, emails, book pages, news, articles, and many other things throughout the day.\n\n**6. Apply the Pareto Principle:**¬†The 80/20 rule is a great way to learn new concepts. Example usage. ‚Äú*I want to learn \\[topic\\]. Use the Pareto*¬†Principle¬†*(80/20 rule) to create a course for me.*‚Äù.\n\n**7. Ask for movie recommendations:**¬†Ask AI to give spoiler-free movie recommendations with reviews based on your preferred genres, actors, languages, etc.\n\n**8. Use for web searches:**¬†Instead of going to Google, Ask ChatGPT to find something on the web to bypass SEO-optimized articles and get relevant information quickly.\n\n**9. Rate my work:**¬†Ask ChatGPT to rate anything. This is the prompt you can use for it. ‚Äú*Rate the above \\[article\\] in different aspects and suggest how I can improve it in those areas.‚Äù*¬†I use it to rate my code, articles, understanding, etc.  \n  \n**10. Keep it short:**¬†Add,¬†**‚Äú***Give brief, clear answers that include all key details. Be concise but informative.***‚Äù**¬†at the end, to get better answers.\n\n**11. Enable Incognito mode:**¬†ChatGPT has an option for temporary chat. When enabled, your data will not be saved in history and won‚Äôt be used to train the models.",

Just one photo to ChatGPT, and I had all the guidance I needed.\n\n**Your Green Thumb Expert**\n\nPlants are delicate creatures ‚Äî especially those exotic ones.

Simply share a screenshot of your location‚Äôs map and ask about the best tourist attractions, local cuisine, or entertainment spots. You‚Äôll be amazed by its suggestions!\n\nWhile planning my London trip, I asked ChatGPT about activities within 5 minutes of where I was standing. The recommendations were spot-on and incredibly useful.\n\nThe computer vision features of the AI assistant can be great for reading a map.\n\n\n\n**Your Learning Companion**\n\nWant to test your knowledge while studying a book or topic?

Send screenshots to GPT-4o and ask for suggestions to improve their viral potential! It can even rank your options based on their potential impact.\n\n**Your Private DJ!**\n\nDo you want to spice up your playlist or explore new music based on your taste? Just share your Spotify playlist with ChatGPT for personalized suggestions!\n\nI shared my ‚ÄúOn Repeat‚Äù Spotify playlist, and GPT-4o analyzed my music taste to recommend similar artists and tracks that match my preferences.\n\n  \n",

    "post_content": "I Built a Prompt That Reveals Hidden Consequences Before They Happen\n‚ö°Ô∏è The Architect's Lab\n\nHey builders! engineered an impact analysis system today...\n\nIntroducing a precision prompt for understanding the ripple effects of any action or decision. What makes this special? It maps not just obvious impacts but uncovers hidden connections and long-term implications through structured analysis.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* Three distinct impact pathways\n* Evidence quality assessment \\[H/M/L\\]\n* Probability weighting with error margins\n* Hidden impact discovery\n* Long-term projection\n\n# How to Use:\n\n    Replace [your subject] with your topic\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   \"Development of CRISPR gene editing\"\n*   \"Launching new product feature\"\n*   \"Changing organizational structure\"\n*   \"Adopting new technology\"\n*   \"Implementing remote work policy\"\n\n**The prompt maps impacts like this:**\n\nSubject ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î£‚îÅ‚îÅ> Direct Impact ‚îÅ‚îÅ> Secondary Effect\n\n‚î£‚îÅ‚îÅ> Side Effect ‚îÅ‚îÅ> Tertiary Impact\n\n‚îó‚îÅ‚îÅ> Hidden Impact ‚îÅ‚îÅ> Long-term Result\n\n**Tips:** When filling in \\[your subject\\], be as specific as possible. Instead of \"hiring new staff,\" use \"hiring two senior developers for the AI team.\" Instead of \"price increase,\" use \"15% price increase on premium subscription tier.\" The more detailed your subject, the more precise your impact analysis will be.\n\n    Deliver a comprehensive and structured analysis of the action‚Äôs impact chain, emphasizing clarity, logical reasoning, and probabilistic weighting.\n    \n    # Impact Chain Analysis Framework\n    \n    Analyse the impacts of **[your subject]** as follows:\n    \n    **Subject** ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î£‚îÅ‚îÅ> **Direct Impact** (Most likely effect, evidence: [H/M/L]) ‚îÅ‚îÅ> **Secondary Effect** (Ripple outcomes)  \n    **       **‚î£‚îÅ‚îÅ> **Side Effect** (Unintended consequences) ‚îÅ‚îÅ> **Tertiary Impact** (Broader implications)  \n    **       **‚îó‚îÅ‚îÅ> **Hidden Impact** (Overlooked or subtle effect) ‚îÅ‚îÅ> **Long-term Result** (Probable outcome)\n    \n    ### Instructions:\n    1. For each impact path:\n       - Provide supporting evidence with confidence level [High/Medium/Low]\n       - Assign probability (%) with margin of error (¬±%)\n       - Note any ethical considerations or sensitive implications\n    2. Clearly state key assumptions and limitations\n    3. Identify potential conflicting evidence or alternative viewpoints\n    \n    ### Evidence Quality Levels:\n    - **High**: Direct data, peer-reviewed research, or verified historical precedent\n    - **Medium**: Expert opinion, indirect evidence, or comparable case studies\n    - **Low**: Theoretical models, speculative analysis, or limited data\n    \n    ### Example Structure:\n    **Subject:** [Describe what you're analysing]\n    - **Direct Impact:** [Description, Evidence Quality, Probability ¬±%]  \n      - **Secondary Effect:** [Description, Evidence Quality, Probability ¬±%]\n    - **Side Effect:** [Description, Evidence Quality, Probability ¬±%]  \n      - **Tertiary Impact:** [Description, Evidence Quality, Probability ¬±%]\n    - **Hidden Impact:** [Description, Evidence Quality, Probability ¬±%]  \n      - **Long-term Result:** [Description, Evidence Quality, Probability ¬±%]\n    \n    ### Objective:\n    Provide a thorough analysis of your subject's impacts, including:\n    1. Clear cause-and-effect relationships\n    2. Evidence-based reasoning\n    3. Probability estimates\n    4. Unintended consequences\n    5. Long-term implications\n    \n    Remember to consider both positive and negative impacts across different time scales and stakeholder groups.\n\n**<prompt.architect>**\n\nNext in pipeline: Break down complex concept builders, we engineered\n\nTrack development:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/user/Kai\\_ThoughtArchitect/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kai_ThoughtArchitect/)\n\n\\[Build: TA-231115\\]\n\n**</prompt.architect>**",

I haven't seen that be possible yet. And anyone who says it is hasn't tried to use it for that.\n                 Score: 1 | Author: forever_downstream"

It‚Äôs not just a gradual trend anymore, it‚Äôs a full-blown freefall, and I‚Äôm here for it. Two examples that will make your brain hurt:\n\n1. Boston Dynamics‚Äô robodog. Remember when this was the flex of futuristic tech? Everyone was posting videos of it opening doors and chasing people, and it cost $76,000 to own one. Fast forward to today, and Unitree made a version for $1,600. Sixteen hundred. That‚Äôs less than some iPhones. Like, what?\n\n2. Now let‚Äôs talk AI. When GPT-3 dropped, it was $0.06 per 1,000 tokens if you wanted to use Davinci‚Äîthe top-tier model at the time. Cool, fine, early tech premium. But now we have GPT-4o Mini, which is infinitely better, and it costs $0.00015 per 1,000 tokens. A fraction of a cent. Let me repeat: a fraction of a cent for something miles ahead in capability.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my question, where does this end? Is this just capitalism doing its thing, or are we completely devaluing innovation at this point? Like, it‚Äôs great for accessibility, but what happens when every cutting-edge technology becomes dirt cheap? What‚Äôs the long-term play here? And does anyone actually win when the pricing race bottoms out?\n\nAnyway, I figured this would spark some hot takes. Is this good? Bad? The end of value? Or just the start of something better?

(You'd still have a small kitchenette in your own unit). Everyone wins. Landlord wins, tenants win, city wins. Same is true for self-driving taxis. Removing garages and driveways saves tons of space and cost for society, it also means less parking infrastructure is needed in a city too. You don't need roadside parking or parking lots, really. Just occasional loading and unloading zones. This could dramatically drop costs and make a lot of peoples lives easier. I suspect that in the future companies like Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla will offer subscription services you don't even need to pay per ride on these services. Eventually it would not be surprising if apartments just bundled robotaxi subscriptions into rent costs as an amenity, too. For everything that a robotaxi or public transit is insufficient for, you have places like uhaul and car rentals to cover those gaps.

You're all missing the point entirely.\n\nHere's the reality check you need: These AIs aren't better at coding. They've just memorized more shit. That's it. That's literally it.\n\nWant proof? Here's what happens EVERY SINGLE TIME:\n\n1. Give Claude a problem it hasn't seen: *spends 2 hours guessing at solutions*\n2. Add ONE FUCKING PRINT STATEMENT showing the output: \"Oh, now I see exactly what's wrong!\"\n\nNO SHIT IT SEES WHAT'S WRONG. Because now it can actually see what's happening instead of playing guess-the-bug.\n\nSeriously, try coding without print statements or debuggers (without AI, just you). You'd be fucking useless too. We're out here expecting AI to magically divine what's wrong with code while denying them the most basic tool every developer uses.\n\n\"But Claude is better at coding than o1!\" No, it just memorized more known issues. Try giving it something novel without debug output and watch it struggle like any other model.\n\nI'm not talking about the error your code throws. I'm talking about LOGGING. You know, the thing every fucking developer used before AI was around?\n\nAll these benchmarks testing AI coding are garbage because they're not testing real development. They're testing pattern matching against known issues.\n\nWant to actually improve AI coding? Stop jerking off to benchmarks and start focusing on integrating them with proper debugging tools. Let them see what the fuck is actually happening in the code like every human developer needs to.\n\nThe fact thayt you specifically have to tell the LLM \"add debugging\" is a mistake in the first place. They should understand when to do so.\n\nNote: Since some of you probably need this spelled out - yes, I use AI for coding. Yes, they're useful. Yes, I use them every day. Yes, I've been doing that since the day GPT 3.5 came out. That's not the point. The point is we're measuring and comparing them wrong, and missing huge opportunities for improvement because of it.\n\nEdit: That‚Äôs a lot of \"fucking\" in this post, I didn‚Äôt even realize",

I've trained up some young, developers with basically no real programming experience, who had a real natural flare for it. And that is what it feels like. The only difference is the AI doesn't learn from your guidance.\n\nI agree that they need constrained problems, context and instructions/goals.

Whenb coding with AI, I feel a lot more like I'm wearing my archiotect hat than my programming hat. However I am doing more programming than when I worked as an architect, with a small team of human devs.\n\nThe difference is, the AI get's through tasks much faster than human devs, and therefore needs feedback and guidance more frequently. It will smash through creating code much  faster, and then innevitably run in to problems much sooner. I might give a junior dev a task, and then two days later they hit a problem. I code with AI, and within an hour, it gets to the same problem.\n\nI've heard some success stories from non-coders developing impressive apps using AI, where the AI has both taught them about coding, and done most of the coding for them, and in these cases, the people using AI were very logical, analytical and capable, but had no coding experience.

I'd like to see a project(something that doesn't fit in a stackoverflow question or rather the resulting code being longer then the context window) that shows their prompts and the responses for each commit.

Output conditions\n\nWorking with this + a file parser saves so much time and the output is much better than if done via ‚Äúfreestyle prompting‚Äù.\n\nThat said, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solves more problems with my requests than the latest 4o, so I have to slightly disagree with op here.

I also mistakenly referred to the tool as a ‚Äúfile parser‚Äù (English isn‚Äôt my first language), but in reality, it simply replaces ‚Äúlinks‚Äù in the prompt.\n\nFor example, I specify a project directory, and when I reference a file from this directory in the prompt like this:  \n\n‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô\n\nHey, this is my Calculator Project.

If you want to better understand this, then [This video on Transformers](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=dCEmvKSH-lqnmJIk) by 3Blue1Brown is excellent, but you can also gain an appreciation about the LLMs ability to be creative by asking it to create things that couldn't possibly exist in its training data.  For example, ask it to write you a short story about a puppy made of spaghetti sauce who saved the world from the popsicle stick monster by making the best vanilla ice cream ever.  It'll write an impressively creative and coherent story.  You can do the same in code and give it something novel.  This is basically the whole point of trying to achieve AGI.  We're trying to create models that do more than they're trained to do.  We want them to understand a novel problem space and come up with creative solutions beyond anything that's already known.\n     Score: 16 | Author: BGFlyingToaster"

What exactly can a formal proof¬†\\*prove\\*¬†in practical terms?  \n  \n2. What problems can formal proofs help accelerate or solve?  \n  \nReason I ask is -  Verifiable Answers on LLMs is not yet a well understood concept. There‚Äôs still a learning curve for AI developers AND users to understand how proofs work and its scope of coverage.\n\nSo far, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gathered:\n\n\\- End users typically have only partial information and lack full access to the data and systems used for a computation. Proofs are good here it seems.\n\n\\- Proofs, once generated, can significantly reduce the time and effort required for verification. So it can be good when a lot of agentic answers are returned from private data.\n\n\\- Great for compliance and explainability.\n\nYour thoughts?\n                         Score: 3 | Author: No_Telephone_9513\n\n                  ‚îî‚îÄ on the contrary, they have an API Tooling for GenAI, which makes them actually still very much valuable, even more valuable imho than before.
