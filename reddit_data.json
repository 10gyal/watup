My argument goes somewhat like this. Clearly, we can do hard imagination. This is likely due to our evolution, where having the imagination to find original and unconventional solutions to problems yielded better survival chances (and opportunities with the ladies :) ). Evolution contains two parts: mutation and selection.\n\nThe mutation part in RL comes from experimentation. An epsilon greedy strategy, for instance takes the best action (per current knowledge) with a large probability and with epsilon probability experiments. If the experiment is successful, it improves the knowledge and may even become the best action. This is the selection part. When done right, this kind of thing brings the mental model closer to the real world model, so that reasoning forward with the mental model is likely to correlate well with the results from the world.\n\nIf one has a good model derived in this way via RL, one can now have a better chance at hard imagination.

But here are some extra points :\n\n* Learn to diffuse your attention. Attention is your main tool for all consciousness and mental related issues. You are the observer, not the thing. Move your attention on various events on your body. It will focus on the depression move it toward other things you feel, even menial things. It needs to move around. Then focus on the interactions between theses sensations, aka the mental process aka the support emotion. Then circulate it again. Relentlessly. You will need one month of constant attention for six months of suffering. You're training yourself to change your routines. You are remolding what you are mentally. Diffusion.\n\n* This one will help you for incurable pain with no physical damage. The pain is real and in your mind. Not elsewhere. https://tmswiki.org\n\n* There is an inner child that hurts inside. What he say is different from physical pain, from the content of the depression that is generally \"installed suffering\" (pip install pain). Once you learn to listen to it and follow it, things will go uphill.

Here's a breakdown of why I likely struggled to see the sixth digit:\n * Training Data Bias: AI models learn from massive datasets of images. If the dataset contains predominantly images of hands with five digits, the model becomes biased towards that configuration. It might struggle to recognize deviations from the norm.\n * Focus on Typical Features: When analyzing images, AI models often focus on the most common and prominent features. In the case of a hand, these might be the overall shape, the presence of five digits, and the relative proportions of the palm and fingers. A less common feature like an extra digit might be overlooked.\n * Semantic Overload: As we saw in our conversation, I got bogged down in the semantics of \"finger\" vs. \"digit.\" This indicates that my reasoning and language processing interfered with my pure visual processing. I was trying to fit the image into a preconceived notion of what a hand should look like, rather than simply observing what was there.\n * Subtle Modification: Depending on how the photo was modified, the extra digit might have been blended in a way that made it less salient. If the lighting, skin texture, and proportions were carefully manipulated, it could be easy to miss, even for a computer vision model.\nIn essence, I failed to see the sixth finger due to a combination of factors: biases in my training data, a focus on typical features, interference from my language processing, and potentially the subtlety of the image modification.\nThis is an area of ongoing research and development in AI.
