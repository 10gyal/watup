They aren't the same thing. \n\n\nYou're not not getting hired because of \"social status\" is my guess. You say you social skills suck when it comes to interviews. That is, unfortunately,  something that does need to be worked on. And again, it's not the same thing as \"social status\". \n\n\nSocial skills ARE important in a job. It might not seem like it, but I've worked so many jobs where someone who is qualified can kill morale with how they interact with coworkers and clients compared to some people who are less qualified but put in the work to get along with coworkers and clients. \n\n\nI'm not a social person outside of work. I'm pretty introverted. But I've landed jobs I was not qualified for because I've learned to kick ass in interviews. You have to literally dress the part first. And always overdress (to a point) for the interview. Be early. Be enthusiastic and appreciative. Smile smile smile. Ask questions back about the workplace. \n\n\nYou don't have to be social.

Treat the interviewer like you are friends.

Crack a witty joke or comment on something they’re wearing or something in the room. Ask them questions that bring down that little wall of professionalism they put up for the candidate. Recruiters hire people who are mostly meet qualifications, seem reliable, and they feel they could enjoy working with you. Pay attention to your body language, stay relaxed.

We don't judge based on social status but if the person we are interviewing (which is called a pre-screen, hiring managers do the actual interview) is rude, we have to relay that to the manager. I have seen highly qualified people get rejected because they acted rude to the hiring manager, the recruiter, or someone on the HM's team. This is not because of HR. This is because the person who will be your boss does not want to work with someone 40 hours a week that they don't enjoy being around. If the recruiter believes the person will be a jerk, we are required to mention it to the HM or else we could lose our job.\n\nI am not saying it's that you are rude, but it's possible that you are coming across that way to the person interviewing you. \n\nCould you give me a little more information on what you mean by \"Social Status\".

I think not.\nI'm 56 and have been fortunate enough to have only 4 jobs in the past 28 years. I ended up leaving a company I helped co-found this year after 18 years and have been looking for a job since August. I've probably applied for a couple of hundred jobs and have gotten call-backs from only 3 during that time, none of which panned out. It's been almost four months and I'm beginning to feel a little desperate.\n\nI always figured that my experience would be an asset, so I always started my resume bio and cover letters with a statement about how I had \"over 28 years of experience\" in the industry (advertising/web development), thinking that'd impress potential employers. But late last week I began to think that maybe my age was holding me back, so I changed my into to \"18+ years of experience,\" since that matched the number of years that I was at my former job. \n\nBingo!\n\nI sent out about ten applications between Friday (12/13) and today (12/17) and got my first contact from a recruiter on Friday, literally minutes after I applied for a job. I got my second recruiter contact today, about two hours after applying. Both sound promising, although I'm still waiting to hear back about an interview.\n\nLesson? Age discrimination is real, folks. My theory for my own case is that rather than impressing recruiters, my declaration about having \"28 years of experience\" at the top of my resume and cover letters got me rejected instantly. It's not like I'm trying to hide how long I've been working in the profession -- anyone with half a brain could look at the dates of the three jobs I list on my resume and do the math -- but now that I'm not specifically calling out the total time I'm no longer being virtually tossed into the \"geriatric\" pile.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? \n\n",

I earned 180k. I can’t believe that the jobs I am interviewing for are being taken by doctors - MD or MD-PhD even. The jobs don’t require an MD, though it is preferred, because why not? I think doctors have figured out this hack - during the day they put in a few hours on this job, get all the benefits of a fulltime job. but since it is remote, the rest of the day they do clinical reviews online which brings in a whole other fat paycheck. This way they get to sit at home and never have to see a single patient. This way they end up earning 800k easy. \nMeanwhile, our local hospitals are shortstaffed on doctors all the time. I wonder why.\n\nEdit: In case this wasn’t obvious in my post, Im currently laid off! So not earning anything right now! And those who dont know, Pharma field is going through an unprecedented bad time and thousands of jobs are getting cut daily. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks all for making this a happening post!
