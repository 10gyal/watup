    "post_summary": "In the first post, the author discusses their work on a **flux LoRA** model for their **Nebelung cat, Tutu**, having initially trained it with **20 images** and **2,000 steps**. They plan to increase the dataset to **100+ photos** and extend training to **5,000+ steps** to improve detail and consistency, while considering renting an **8x H100 GPU** setup and seeking community insights on the benefits and potential overfitting risks of these changes. The second post expresses a desire for a prompt to configure **ChatGPT as a psychiatrist and addiction counselor**, emphasizing the need for a responsive, knowledgeable resource for personal issues.",
    "comment_summary": "In the discussion about training a **flux LoRA** model, several users emphasized the importance of dataset quality, advocating for a minimum of **15 steps** during training to capture better epochs. They suggested avoiding mirroring images and recommended using high-quality squared images (preferably **1024x1024**) to prevent blurry results, along with a strategy for optimizing captions.\n\nFor the ChatGPT prompt focused on therapy, contributors praised the structured approach provided, with one user mentioning their experience with a different AI therapist called **Mia**. The conversation humorously highlighted the trend of using AI for personal issues, with some jesting about the potential costs involved."
